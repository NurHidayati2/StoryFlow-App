# Notes:
# - If you have a Story API endpoint, set CONFIG.BASE_URL in src/scripts/config.js to that base URL (e.g. https://example.com/api)
# - The map page uses Leaflet and will fallback to local sample-data.json if no API is configured.
# - To enable multiple tile layers, no API key is required for OSM and Stamen used here.

# NOTE: MVP pattern applied for Home and About via presenters. Add page includes camera capture (mediaDevices.getUserMedia). Ensure to test camera on a secure context (https or localhost).
